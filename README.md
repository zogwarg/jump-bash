# Jump-bash

This is a bash-only adaptation of the https://github.com/flavio/jump utility tool, to bookmark locations in the cli.

# Installation

jump-bash requires jq to work
```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
```

It can then be activated by including the following line in you ~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file
```bash
source jump-bash.sh
```
